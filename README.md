# Profanity-Checker
This project checks entered words or phrases against a dababase of profanity. 


How to use:

1) Include the db.js and check.js scripts in the head section.

2) Pass in the word or phrase to the ProfanityChecker() function. It will return true or false.
Eg, here we do the following: var match = ProfanityChecker(document.getElementById('phrase').value);
alert(match);
